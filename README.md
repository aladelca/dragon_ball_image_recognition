# Convolutional Neural Network for image recognition

**Objective:**

The goal of this project is to train a CNN to perform an image recognition task based on [Dragon Ball Z dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/insaiyancvk/dragon-ball-z-dataset?select=DBZ). 

**Collaboration**

This project was developed as part of a lecture that I gave on Data Analytics and Predictive Modelling course in [Applied Science Peruvian University](https://www.upc.edu.pe/)
